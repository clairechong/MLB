The question that we are trying to answer is how to better measure player performance in baseball.  Batting average is a flawed measure because it doesn’t factor in other ways that a batter could reach base and it does not consider the type of hit (whether single or extra base), giving all hits the same weight.     

Consider the OPS – on base percentage plus slugging average - which reflects the ability of a player to get on base and to hit for power  which some would argue is a better predictor of runs scored and wins than batting average. We are interested in seeing relationships between OPS and the various parameters and using it to predict improvement in performance from one year to the next.  This information is helpful to organizations who are constantly trying to find different ways to value players to maximize team success.  Players who are constantly improving themselves rather than staying stagnant or declining are an asset to any team.
